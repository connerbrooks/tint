Tint
====

Extremely minimal Android application to control Hue lightbulbs.
Attempts to adhere to material design principles.
In many respects I find this to be much more responsive than the official Hue app.

Based on the [QuickStartApp](https://github.com/PhilipsHue/PhilipsHueSDK-Java-MultiPlatform-Android) provided by Philips Hue.

## Features
